               <li>Place the other slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese</li> 
               <li>Wait approximately 1 to 2 minutes (or till the bread touching the skillet is a golden brown)</li> 
               <li>Flip the sandwich over with some awesome pizazz and cook the other side till golden brown (approximately 1 to 2 minutes)</li>

        <p>
            Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The result will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.

        <br>Remember, Shaun says "Grilled cheese sandwiches are a staple of the North American diet!".
